### Stashing

```bash
$ git stash                         # stash half-done code into stack except untracked files
$ git stash -u                      # stash any changed files
$ git stash -p                      # prompt which of changes you would like to stash
$ git stash branch new_branch_name  # create new branch with stash and drop it from stack
$
$ git stash list                    # list stored stashes
$
$ git stash apply                   # apply stored stash but the file you staged before wasnâ€™t restaged
$ git stash apply --index           # apply stored stash and reapply the staged changes
$ git stash pop                     # apply stored stash and drop it from stack immediately
$
$ git stash drop                    # drop stash from stack
$
$ git revert HEAD                   # record a new commit to revert last commit
$ git revert <commit>               # record a new commit to revert specific commit
$ git cherry-pick <commit>          # reverse to `git revert`, record a new commit to apply specific commit change
$
$ git reset --soft <commit>         # reset to specific commit and keep the changes in index
$ git reset --hard <commit>         # reset to specific commit and discard the changes
```
